Objectives for this section

 -Understand objects conceptually
 -write code using JS objects

 objects

 var person = {
     name: "Cid",
     age: 32,
     City: "LA"
 }

 -objects don't have any built in order
 -more usefull than arrays at organizing lists by type

 --to retrieve data--

 braket or dot notations

 -bracket
 console.log(person.["name"]);

-when used with brakets you can lookup what a variable is equal to 

///example///

var str = "name";

person.str // will only look for a str property in the objects

person[str] // will evaluate the variable str and then look for the property that it is equal to

////

 -dot
 console.log(person.name);
 
 rules!!
 cannot use dot notation if 
 -starts with number
 -if has a space in it
