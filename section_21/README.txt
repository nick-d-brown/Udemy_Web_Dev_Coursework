This section covers the basic comands that can be used in the terminal. These are:

cd                      (change directory, go back using .. after cd)
ls                      (list, lists all items in the current directory)
pwd                     (print working directory)
touch <file name>       (creates a new file in the working directory)
code <file name>        (both creates a new file and opens that new file in your code editor - must be saved still)
mkdir <folder name>     (creates a new folder in the working directory)

remove options

rm                      (deletes a specific file)
rm -rf                  (rf ==stands for recursive force== is a flag that removes the entire directory)
