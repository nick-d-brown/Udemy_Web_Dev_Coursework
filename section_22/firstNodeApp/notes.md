#Using Node

* Interacting with the Node console
    - type in "node" then hit henter
    - - this enters the node console and alows us to interact with JS using REPL (much like in the client)
    - - hit control C to exit

* Run a file with node
    - can execute a JS file by typing "node <file name>"
